# **API Gateway - Middle-End Architecture**  

## **Overview**  
In a microservices architecture, we introduce an **intermediate layer (Middle-End)** between the **Frontend** and **Backend** to enhance communication and decision-making.  

## **Why Middle-End?**  
- It acts as a bridge between the client (Frontend) and microservices (Backend).  
- It helps decide which microservice should handle incoming requests.  
- It improves security, efficiency, and scalability.  

## **Key Features**  
âœ” **Message Validation** â€“ Ensures that incoming requests meet the required format and structure.  
âœ” **Response Transformation** â€“ Converts backend responses into a format suitable for the frontend.  
âœ” **Rate Limiting** â€“ Prevents API abuse by limiting the number of requests per user.  
âœ” **API Gateway** â€“ Serves as the middleware to manage these operations.  

## **Conclusion**  
By implementing an API Gateway as a **Middle-End**, we optimize request handling, improve performance, and ensure seamless integration between the client and backend services. ðŸš€
